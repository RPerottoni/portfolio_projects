							<h2>About Me<br/></h2>
							</header>
							<p>My name is Ricardo Perottoni, originaly I am from Brazil and I am currently living in Dublin - Ireland. </p>
							   I have a Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering with a background in manufacturing, HVAC, construction and quality assurance fields. And I am currently working as a BIM Engineer. </p>
							   I have always been passionate for technology and around 2 years ago, had the opportunity to work by doing dashboards, data analysis and presentations. In some moment I realised that I trully want to work with data.
							   Since then I started to study Data Science, aiming to improve my knowledge and skills.</p>
							   I am impressed by the potential information contained in simple data and how this information could be helpful. And my objective is to help you utilize your data to create solutions rather than just storing it.

					<h2>EXPERIENCES</h2>
					</header>
					<h3><strong>3+ Projects Completed in Data Science Area</strong></h3>
					<p>I have built solutions for business problems that closely resemble real-life challenges. I have achieved this by utilizing publicly available datasets from
					   Data Science competitions. Throughout the process, I approached the problem from the conception of the business challenge to the deployment of the trained algorithm.
					   Additionally, I utilized Cloud Computing tools to facilitate this process.

					<h3><strong>7+ years of experience working in Quality Manufacturing sector</strong></h3>
					<p>During this period, I had the opportunity to work on various tasks within this field. Primarily, I focused on solving customer problems, developing and analyzing
					   key performance indicators (KPIs), conducting mechanical assays such as metalography, hardness tests, tensile tests, and salt-spray tests. I also had the
					   responsibility of developing technical documentation, including PPAP (Production Part Approval Process), FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis), and product
					   certificates.
					   Furthermore, I conducted internal audits following ISO 9001 and 14001 standards, provided product training and quality tool training for the team. In the past year,
					   I utilized RPA (Robotic Process Automation) tools to automate tasks and process, which significantly helped the company navigate through the challenges posed by the pandemic.

					<h3><strong>+2 years of experience working on Engineering field</strong></h3>
					<p> Working as BIM Engineer on a semiconductor industry construction, by creating isometric drawings, technical documentation and pipe design, runing clash detection, cloud scangs alignment and cordinations with different areas.</p>
