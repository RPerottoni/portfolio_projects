											<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
										</header>
										<p> <p>
											I'm Ricardo Perottoni, a Mechanical Engineer with over 8 years of experience in quality systems and process optimization, currently based in Dublin, Ireland.  
											My transition into Data Science began two years ago when I realized the untapped potential of manufacturing data in my previous roles.  
											What started with building dashboards and automating reports quickly evolved into a deeper passion for extracting insights, building predictive models, and solving real business problems using data.
										  </p>
										  
										  <p>
											Since then, I've been fully immersed in the field—studying, building practical end-to-end projects, and exploring tools such as Python, SQL, Power BI, and machine learning frameworks.  
											My portfolio includes everything from customer segmentation dashboards and sales forecasting models to automated data pipelines and deployed APIs.
										  </p>
										  
										  <p>
											My goal is to join a data-driven team as a Data Scientist or Data Analyst, where I can apply my analytical mindset, technical skills, and engineering background to create meaningful impact.  
											I’m especially interested in roles where I can combine technical challenges with business understanding, and continuously grow in a collaborative environment.

												<h2>PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES</h2>
												</header>
												<h3>3+ Projects Completed in DataScience Area</h3>
												<p>I have built solutions for business problems that closely resemble real-life challenges.<br/> 
													I have achieved this by utilizing publicly available datasets from
													Data Science competitions. Throughout the process, I approached the problem from the conception of the business challenge to the deployment of the trained algorithm.
													Additionally, I utilized Cloud Computing tools to facilitate this process.
												<h3>7+ years of experience working in Quality Manufacturing sector</h3>
												<p>During this period, I had the opportunity to work on various tasks within this field. Primarily, I focused on solving customer problems, developing and analyzing
													key performance indicators (KPIs), conducting mechanical assays such as metalography, hardness tests, tensile tests, and salt-spray tests.<br/> 
													I also had the responsibility of developing technical documentation, including PPAP (Production Part Approval Process), FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis), and product
													certificates.<br/>
													Furthermore, I conducted internal audits following ISO 9001 and 14001 standards, provided product training and quality tool training for the team. In the past year,
													I utilized RPA (Robotic Process Automation) tools to automate tasks and process, which significantly helped the company navigate through the challenges posed by the pandemic.
												
													<h3><strong>+2 years of experience working on Engineering field</strong></h3>
												<p> Working as BIM Engineer on a semiconductor industry construction, by creating isometric drawings, technical documentation and pipe design, runing clash detection, cloud scangs alignment and cordinations with different areas.</p>

										<h3>Customer Segmentation for Loyalty Program</h3>
											<p>
											Created a customer segmentation model to support loyalty program strategies by identifying behavioral patterns in a retail customer base.
											Using purchase frequency, recency, and monetary value, the goal was to classify customers into meaningful groups for targeted marketing actions.
											</p>
											<p>
											Applied unsupervised learning techniques (K-Means, GMM, Hierarchical Clustering) on an RFM matrix to group customers with similar profiles.  
											Evaluated the quality of clusters using Silhouette Score and embedding visualization techniques.
											</p>
											<p>
											This project enabled a data-driven understanding of customer value and behavior, helping guide retention strategies and campaign personalization.
											</p>
											<h4>Main Tools</h4>
											<ul>
											<li>Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook</li>
											<li>RFM Matrix, K-Means, GMM, Hierarchical Clustering</li>
											<li>Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn</li>
